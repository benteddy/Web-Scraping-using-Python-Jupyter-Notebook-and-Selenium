# Web Scrapping using Python Jupyter Notebook and Selenium
By using python jupyter-notebook, I do web scrapping to get data and information from a website automatically. In this project, I obtain the data table of "Date and Rates" in website https://www.bi.go.id/en/statistik/informasi-kurs/jisdor/Default.aspx without manually downloading through the "download" button. This project uses python jupyter notebook and selenium to get the table data and export the table into csv file format.<br/><br/>
